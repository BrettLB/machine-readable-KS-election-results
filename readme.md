# Machine Readable KS Election Results

PDFs suck for data analysis. I have taken the election results documents created by the Kansas Secretary of State and parsed the PDFs to create nice tidy JSON documents.

Please make a pull request if you note any parsing errors of have suggestions for improvements.

If this is helpful to you, please encourage the KS Secretary of State office to start publishing documents in a machine readable format.
